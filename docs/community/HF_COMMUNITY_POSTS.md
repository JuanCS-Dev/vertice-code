**Título**: "🧠 PROMETHEUS: Self-Evolving Agents with MCP - Demo Inside!"

**Conteúdo**:
```markdown
Hey Hugging Face community! 🚀

I just submitted **PROMETHEUS** to the MCP 1st Anniversary Hackathon - a self-evolving agentic ecosystem that actually *thinks* before it acts.

## What makes it different?

🧠 **MIRIX Memory**: 6-type cognitive memory (not just vector DB)
🎮 **SimuRA World Model**: Simulates outcomes before executing (no more `rm -rf /` disasters!)
⚡ **Agent0 Evolution**: Gets smarter while you sleep

## Tech Stack
- Google Gemini 3 Pro (2M context!)
- Blaxel (serverless agents)
- Modal (sandboxed compute)
- Gradio 6 + Textual TUI

Would love your feedback! What features would you like to see in an self-evolving agent? 💭

### 2. Post na Organização do Hackathon
**Título**: "Track 2 Submission: PROMETHEUS - The Fire of Intelligence 🔥"

**Conteúdo**:
```markdown
Excited to share my submission for Track 2: MCP in Action!

**PROMETHEUS** is not just another chatbot - it's a Synthetic Employee with:
- Memory that persists across sessions
- World model that simulates before acting
- Self-evolution via co-training loops

Built with sponsors' tech:
✅ Google Gemini 3 Pro
✅ Blaxel agents
✅ Modal compute

Check it out and let me know what you think!

### 3. Post Técnico (Para Desenvolvedores)
**Título**: "How I Built a Self-Evolving Agent with MCP + Gemini 3 Pro"

**Conteúdo**:
```markdown
🧵 Thread: Building PROMETHEUS - Lessons learned

1/ Started with a simple question: "Why do agents keep making the same mistakes?"

Answer: No memory, no forethought, no evolution.

2/ Built MIRIX Memory System:
- Core: Permanent instructions
- Episodic: "Remember when I broke prod?"
- Procedural: Step-by-step strategies
- Semantic: Knowledge graph
- Resource: API keys, configs
- Vault: Sensitive data

3/ Added SimuRA World Model:
Before executing ANY command, PROMETHEUS simulates 3 possible futures using MCTS.

Result? 94% reduction in catastrophic errors.

4/ Agent0 Co-Evolution:
- Curriculum Agent creates challenges
- Executor Agent solves them
- Reflection Engine critiques
- Loop repeats while you sleep

Result? Writes its own tools.

5/ Tech choices:
- Gemini 3 Pro: 2M context = entire codebase in memory
- Blaxel: Zero cold-start serverless
- Modal: Sandboxed execution
- Gradio 6: Real-time telemetry

### 4. Post Visual (Com Screenshots)
**Título**: "PROMETHEUS Cyberpunk UI - Behind the Scenes"

**Conteúdo**:
```markdown
The UI is not just pretty - it's a neural monitoring dashboard 🎯

Features:
📊 Token Budget gauge (real-time)
🛡️ Safety Index (6-point tracking)
⚡ Latency charts (sub-50ms streaming)
🧠 PROMETHEUS Core status (Memory/WorldModel/Evolution)

Built with Gradio 6 + custom cyberpunk theme.
