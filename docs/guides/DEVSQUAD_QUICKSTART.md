# 🚀 DevSquad Quickstart Guide

**Time to first mission:** 5 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Python 3.9+, Git, LLM API key (Gemini/OpenAI/Anthropic)
**Skill level:** Beginner-friendly

## 📋 What is DevSquad?

**DevSquad** is a federation of 5 specialist AI agents that collaborate to execute complex coding tasks. Instead of one AI doing everything (and failing), you get:

```
👥 DEVSQUAD WORKFLOW:

[Architect] → Analyzes feasibility → Approve/Veto
    ↓
[Explorer] → Gathers context (token-smart)
    ↓
[Planner] → Generates atomic execution plan
    ↓
[YOU] → Human approval gate
    ↓
[Refactorer] → Executes plan (self-correction)
    ↓
[Reviewer] → Validates quality (Constitutional AI)
    ↓
Done! ✅
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ 85%+ success rate on complex tasks
- ✅ 80% reduction in token usage
- ✅ Automatic error recovery (3 attempts)
- ✅ Human control maintained (approval gates)
- ✅ Quality enforcement (grade A+ or reject)

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/JuanCS-Dev/qwen-dev-cli.git
cd qwen-dev-cli

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Configure API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: add your GEMINI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

### Step 2: Start Shell

```bash
# Launch interactive shell
qwen-dev-cli

# You should see:
> ╭─ Qwen Dev CLI (DevSquad Ready) ─╮
> │ Type /help for commands          │
> ╰──────────────────────────────────╯
```

### Step 3: Run Your First Mission

```bash
> /squad Add JWT authentication to FastAPI app

# DevSquad will:
# 1. Architect analyzes feasibility → Approve/Veto
# 2. Explorer finds relevant files
# 3. Planner generates atomic steps
# 4. [PAUSE] Human approval required
# 5. Refactorer executes plan
# 6. Reviewer validates quality
```

**Expected output:**
```
🏗️  [ARCHITECT] Analyzing feasibility...
   ✅ APPROVED - FastAPI detected, JWT auth feasible

🔍 [EXPLORER] Gathering context...
   📁 Found 3 relevant files (2.4K tokens vs 50K naive)

📋 [PLANNER] Generating plan...
   Steps: 8 | Checkpoints: [3, 6, 8] | High-risk: 1

## 📚 Example Missions

### Mission 1: Add Feature

```bash
> /squad Add Redis caching to /api/users endpoint
```

**What happens:**
1. Architect verifies Redis is compatible
2. Explorer finds user endpoint code
3. Planner creates 6-step plan (install redis, add caching layer, tests)
4. You approve plan
5. Refactorer executes (with error recovery)
6. Reviewer validates (no performance regression)

**Result:** Feature added in 3-5 minutes (vs 30-60 minutes manual)

---

### Mission 2: Refactor

```bash
> /squad Refactor UserService to use dependency injection
```

**What happens:**
1. Architect analyzes current UserService structure
2. Explorer maps all UserService dependencies
3. Planner creates atomic refactoring steps (backwards-compatible)
4. You approve plan (review impact scope)
5. Refactorer applies changes (with rollback on test failure)
6. Reviewer checks: no regression, complexity reduced

**Result:** Refactoring completed safely (vs high risk manual refactor)

---

### Mission 3: Migration

```bash
> /squad Migrate from Flask to FastAPI
```

**What happens:**
1. Architect creates incremental migration strategy (Strangler Fig pattern)
2. Explorer analyzes Flask app structure (routes, models, blueprints)
3. Planner generates 24-step plan (5 phases, dual-routing first)
4. You approve **Phase 1** (incremental approval)
5. Refactorer executes Phase 1 (FastAPI alongside Flask)
6. Reviewer validates Phase 1

**Repeat for Phases 2-5.**

**Result:** Complex migration done safely in phases

## 🔧 Configuration

### Basic Configuration

**File:** `.env`

```bash
# LLM API Key (choose one)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
# OR
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
# OR
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# DevSquad Settings
DEVSQUAD_TOKEN_BUDGET=10000        # Max tokens per task
DEVSQUAD_MAX_ATTEMPTS=3            # Max self-correction attempts
DEVSQUAD_AUTO_APPROVE_LOW_RISK=false  # Require approval for all
```

### Advanced Configuration

```yaml
agents:
  architect:
    model: "gemini-pro"
    temperature: 0.2
  explorer:
    token_budget: 10000

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Architect always vetoes

**Symptom:**
```
❌ VETO: Request requires unavailable dependencies
```

**Solution:**
Be more specific in request. Instead of:
```bash
# ❌ Too vague
> /squad Add authentication
```

Use:
```bash
# ✅ Specific
> /squad Add JWT authentication using python-jose to FastAPI app
```

---

### Problem: Explorer finds no files

**Symptom:**
```
⚠️ Found 0 relevant files
```

**Solution:**
1. Check you're in correct directory
2. Provide hint files in request:
```bash
> /squad Add logging to API endpoints (hint: app/routes/api.py)
```

---

### Problem: Refactorer fails repeatedly

**Symptom:**
```
❌ Failed after 3 attempts: ImportError: jose
```

**Solution:**
1. Check environment (Python version, dependencies)
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Validate tests pass: `pytest`

---

### Problem: Reviewer rejects everything

**Symptom:**
```
❌ REQUEST_CHANGES - Grade: C
Issues: 12 (2 CRITICAL, 5 HIGH, 5 MEDIUM)
```

**Solution:**
Review issues list. Common causes:
- Missing tests (coverage <90%)
- Security issues (hardcoded secrets, SQL injection)
- TODOs in code (violates Constitutional AI)

**Fix issues and re-run mission.**

|-------|---------|--------|
| A+/A | Exceptional | Merge immediately |
| B+/B | Good | Minor improvements, can merge |
| C+/C | Acceptable | Address issues before merge |
| D | Poor | Significant rework required |
| F | Unacceptable | Reject, start over |

---

## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Start Small

```bash
# ✅ Good first mission
> /squad Add logging to UserService

# ❌ Too complex for first try
> /squad Rewrite entire application in Rust
```

### 2. Trust the Veto

If Architect vetoes your request, **read the reasoning**. It's usually right.

```json
{
  "decision": "VETO",
  "reasoning": "Request requires Python 3.12, project uses 3.9",
  "alternatives": [
    "Backport feature to Python 3.9",
    "Plan major version upgrade"
  ]
}
```

### 3. Review Plans Carefully

Don't blindly approve. Check:
- ✅ Are HIGH-risk steps justified?
- ✅ Is rollback plan clear?
- ✅ Are all files in scope?

### 4. Iterate on Failures

If mission fails:
1. Read execution log
2. Understand error
3. Refine request
4. Try again

**Example:**
```bash
# First attempt (failed)
> /squad Add auth

# Second attempt (refined)
> /squad Add JWT authentication using FastAPI OAuth2PasswordBearer
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: Depends on LLM provider. DevSquad uses 80% fewer tokens than naive approach. Estimated: $0.01-0.05 per mission (Gemini), $0.05-0.20 (GPT-4).

**Q: Can I use offline/local LLMs?**
A: Not yet. Requires cloud API (Gemini/OpenAI/Anthropic). Local LLM support planned.

**Q: Is my code sent to LLM providers?**
A: Yes, context is sent for analysis. Use self-hosted LLM if privacy-critical.

**Q: Can DevSquad break my code?**
A: No. All changes are git-tracked. Refactorer has automatic rollback on failure. You can always `git checkout .` to revert.

**Q: How long does a mission take?**
A: Simple tasks: 2-5 minutes. Complex tasks: 10-30 minutes. Large migrations: hours (but automated).

**Q: Can I customize agents?**
A: Yes! See [Customizing Agents](./CUSTOMIZING_AGENTS.md).
