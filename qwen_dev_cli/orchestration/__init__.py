DEVSQUAD: Agent Orchestration & Coordination

This module provides the orchestration layer that coordinates multiple
specialist agents to execute complex development workflows.

Components:
    - MemoryManager: Shared context and session state management

Philosophy (Boris Cherny):
    "Coordination is harder than implementation."
    - Explicit state management
    - Type-safe agent communication
    - Atomic operations
    - Production-grade reliability
