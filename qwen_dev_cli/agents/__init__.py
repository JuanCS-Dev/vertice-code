"""
DEVSQUAD: Federation of Specialists - Agent Foundation

This module provides the base abstractions for the multi-agent system where
specialized AI agents collaborate to solve complex development tasks.

Architecture:
    - BaseAgent: Abstract base class for all specialist agents
    - AgentRole: Enum defining specialist roles (Architect, Explorer, etc.)
    - AgentCapability: Enum defining what tools each agent can use
    - AgentTask: Pydantic model for task definition
    - AgentResponse: Pydantic model for agent output

Philosophy (Boris Cherny):
    "Each agent is a specialist, not a generalist."
    - Strict capability enforcement
    - Type-safe communication
    - Zero placeholders
    - Production-ready code only
