Scientific E2E Tests - Phase 8.3

Comprehensive data flow validation with edge cases:
1. Tool Execution Flow: Input → Validation → Execution → Result
2. Agent Pipeline Flow: Request → Planning → Execution → Response
3. Streaming Flow: Source → Chunk Processing → Rendering
4. Error Handling Flow: Error → Propagation → Recovery
5. State Management Flow: State Changes → Persistence → Sync

Methodology:
- Boundary value analysis
- Equivalence partitioning
- State transition coverage
- Error injection testing
- Concurrent stress testing

Following scientific testing principles for 100% data flow coverage.
