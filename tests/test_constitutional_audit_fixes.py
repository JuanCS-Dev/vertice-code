Constitutional Audit Integration Tests

Tests all fixes from Phase 5 Constitutional Audit (Nov 2025).

Validates:
1. AgentRole.EXECUTOR exists in base.py
2. executor.py uses EXECUTOR role
3. executor_nextgen.py uses EXECUTOR role
4. agent_identity.py has executor identity with EXECUTOR role
5. governance_pipeline.py imports correctly
6. All agent identities are registered correctly
