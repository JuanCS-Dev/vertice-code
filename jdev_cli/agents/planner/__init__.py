"""
planner: Goal-Oriented Action Planning System.

This package provides a comprehensive planning system based on:
- GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning) from F.E.A.R.
- Claude Code Plan Mode patterns
- Cursor 2.1 Clarifying Questions
- Devin Confidence Ratings
- Verbalized Sampling (Zhang et al. 2025)

Modules:
- agent: The main PlannerAgent class
- types: Domain types (Enums, Pydantic models)
- goap: GOAP planning with A* pathfinding
- dependency: Dependency graph analysis
- validation: Plan validation and monitoring

Example:
    from jdev_cli.agents.planner import PlannerAgent
    # or
    from jdev_cli.agents.planner.types import ExecutionPlan, SOPStep
    from jdev_cli.agents.planner.goap import GOAPPlanner, WorldState
