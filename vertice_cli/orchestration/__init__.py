DEVSQUAD: Agent Orchestration & Coordination
Pipeline de Diamante - Camada 2: GOVERNANCE GATE

This module provides the orchestration layer that coordinates multiple
specialist agents to execute complex development workflows.

Components:
    - MemoryManager: Shared context and session state management
    - DevSquad: Multi-agent orchestrator (5-phase workflow)
    - WorkflowLibrary: Pre-defined workflow templates
    - DevSquadStateMachine: State machine for phase management

Philosophy (Boris Cherny):
    "Coordination is harder than implementation."
    - Explicit state management
    - Type-safe agent communication
    - Atomic operations
    - Production-grade reliability
